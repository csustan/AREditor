# About The Augmented Reality Editor Application
This AR Editor is a combination of the ThreeJS Editor ( https://threejs.org/editor/ ) and the ARJS Studio ( https://ar-js-org.github.io/studio/ ). It allows users to upload models stored as a GLTF, preform basic edits (such as adjusting the scale, rotation, and lighting) before exporting an Augmented Reality website that uses marker tracking technology to “project” the model into your environment.
